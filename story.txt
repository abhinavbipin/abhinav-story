Once there was a guy that was hungry. But he had been staying up late to do his homework. When he was finally done and had time to get food, the dining hall was closed. So, he ended up eating the classic college meal - ramen noodles.
Later on he no longer liked eating package ramen noodles so he went to Strings Ramen on Frances St. Now he can never eat packaged ramen again!
