Once there was a guy that was hungry. But he had been staying up late to do his homework. When he was finally done and had time to get food, the dining hall was closed. So, he ended up eating the classic college meal - ramen noodles.
Later on he no longer liked eating package ramen noodles so he went to Strings Ramen on Frances St. Now he can never eat packaged ramen again! Secretely Ramen sucks and he should have gone to Chipotle


There was once a man riding off into the sunset on a horse towards what seemed to be  train station. He was waiting for someone, or rather, something. Perhaps a train. He did now know where this train would take him. But he knew where he hoped it woul.
